				<p>The history of Windows dates back to 1981 when Microsoft started work on a program called Interface Manager. It was announced in November 1983 under the name Windows but Windows 1 was not released until November 1985. Windows 1 was to compete with Apple's operating system but achieved little popularity. Windows 1 is not a complete operating system rather, it extends MS-DOS.</p>
